                        <h2>Introduction: What is Teflon</h2>
                        <p>Polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known as Teflon, was discovered accidentally in 1938 when a chemist working within DuPont laboratories was left with a hydrophobic compound after<br>trying to create more efficient refrigeration coolant gas. The compound was<br>then given the brand name “Teflon”. <br><br>80 years on, Teflon has become synonymous with non-stick cooking surfaces such as pots, pans and baking trays. Not only is Teflon used within non-stick cooking surfaces, but it also features<br>in a range of other household appliances including hair straighteners, clothing<br>and self-cleaning ovens. <br><br>Although extremely useful within the home, Teflon has been subject to large amounts of criticism throughout&nbsp; the years due to its alleged carcinogenic properties. This blog post will examine how Teflon is created, how it works and investigate the claims made against the use of Teflon in cookware.<br></p>
                        <h2>How is Teflon made and what is it's chemical composition?</h2>
                        <p>Teflon is a chemical compound that is comprised of fluorspar, hydrofluoric acid, chloroform, and water. Each of these ingredients are mixed in a chemical reaction chamber and are the heated to temperatures ranging from 590 to 900 Celsius. The result is the fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). <br><br>The first product that must be created within this process is tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). Tetrafluoroethylene is synthesized from chloroform, hydrofluoric acid, and fluorspar. These chemicals undergo a process known as pyrolysis. Pyrolysis refers to the process of heating an organic material without oxygen. As a result of the material having no oxygen present around it, the organic material does not combust but rather, the chemical compounds that it is comprised of decompose into combustible gasses or charcoal. <br><br>After the process of pyrolysis, the TFE is transformed into polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) using radical polymerization as well as small amounts of chemicals such as disuccinic acid peroxide or ammonium persulfate. <br><br>These two are the main basics steps that are undertaken during the creation of Teflon, however do not describe the entire process. Many of the steps in between these processes are “industry secrets” and thus are not available to the public as a result. This secrecy has caused a significant amount of controversy as between Teflon’s creation in 1938 until 2015, one of the key ingredients used within the creation process was a surfactant chemical known as Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The use of PFOA has been banned due to the significant health risks it poses to humans, this blog post will delve deeper into this controversy and others surrounding Teflon. <br><br>Aside from the process of creating Teflon, it is also crucial to understand it’s chemical composition. Polytetrafluoroethylene is a compound comprised of only two atoms: carbon and fluorine. The carbon atoms within PTFE form a backbone chain in which each carbon atom is attached to two fluorine atoms. To better conceptualize the chemical structure, below is an interactive 3D model of PTFE:&nbsp;</p><div class="3d-container">

                        <h2>How Teflon works</h2>
                        <p>When referring to Teflon’s non-stick surfaces, we are essentially stating that there exists little friction between the Teflon and any other type of material that it meets. <br><br>The carbon-fluorine bond within Teflon is one of the strongest bonds within organic chemistry. The atoms fluorine within PTFE shields the backbone chain of carbon atoms and prevent it from reacting with other materials. This shield is created as fluorine atoms are highly resistant to any other molecule except itself due to its high electronegativity. Chemicals that possess this characteristic are referred to as “highly inert” and thus provide us with a surface that has virtually zero adhesive force. <br><br>As a result of fluorine being the most electronegative element, fluorine atoms allow PTFE/Teflon surfaces to have a low coefficient of friction. The term coefficient of friction simply refers to how easy it is for two materials to slide past each other. In addition to the inert property of PTFE, PTFE also has a high melting point of 327 °C. This makes it suitable for use within cookware. <br><br>In summary, the presence of fluorine atoms within PTFE allow Teflon to achieve an extremely slippery surface due to the lack of friction between the PTFE and other materials. The high melting point of PTFE allows for it to be used within many common household appliances including cookware.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>The debate surrounding Teflon&nbsp;</h2>
                        <p>Much of the controversy surrounding the use of Teflon has stemmed from the use of Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) within Teflon’s manufacturing process. <br><br>An article published by the American Cancer Society suggests that PFOA may cause health issues such as kidney, testicular, thyroid, prostate, bladder, and ovarian cancer. These potential health issues were discovered across several studies into the effects of PFOA in humans. However, the American Cancer Society states that further research is required to confirm and clarify these findings.<br><br>&nbsp;In addition to the American Cancer Society, an article posted by WebMD and reviewed by medical experts highlights that in 2016, the U.S Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) concluded that PFOA is linked to health issues including: cancers, immune system damage, liver damage, fetus harm, early puberty, and changes in blood pressure during pregnancy. These health impacts were discovered through studies conducted on both lab animals and by gathering data from a large amount of people who had high levels of PFOA exposure. <br><br>The response from DuPont and other Teflon/PTFE manufacturers has been to remove Teflon from the manufacturing process in an attempt to ease the public’s health concerns. It should be noted that Teflon only ceased use of the chemical by 2013, this means that many of the cookware people have in their homes may still contain the chemical! Following this move by manufacturers, the debate surrounding the dangers of Teflon has largely dissipated. However, the PFOA used within the manufacturing process is not the only concern with Teflon. <br><br>Currently, one of the largest concerns surrounding Teflon use in cookware is what happens when the compound is heated above 300°C. When heated to such high temperatures, Teflon begins to break down thus releasing toxic fumes (including PFOA) into the air. If inhaled, these fumes can result in short-term effects such as chills, fever, and head/body aches. Some studies have also shown that inhalation of these fumes may lead to permanent lung damage when the Teflon is heated to temperatures over 390°C.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Personal Assessment &amp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>With all perspectives and evidence in mind, using Teflon in cookware can pose a serious health risk if caution is not taken. To avoid any adverse side effects from using Teflon cookware, two main considerations must be made, these are: <br>• <strong>How old is the cookware? </strong>If the cookware was purchased before 2015, it may contain PFOA. In this case, it is likely a safer move to replace the cookware rather than take the risk of inhaling PFOA fumes. <br>• <strong>How hot will the cookware be heated?</strong> If the Teflon cookware will be heated close to, or above 300°C, it is likely not a good idea to use it. Alternatives to Teflon include stainless steel or cast iron as they provide good scratch resistance thus preventing unwanted sticking. <br><br>Personally, due to the large amount of secrecy/ lack of specific detail behind how Teflon is made due to its trademark status, I would be more inclined to purchase cookware that does not contain Teflon, spending the extra time scrubbing that iron pan may be worth it than running the risk of developing health issues from Teflon.&nbsp;</p>
